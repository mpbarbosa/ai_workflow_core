## AI Recommendations

1. Consolidate documentation: Consider merging subfolders like docs/advanced, docs/developers, docs/testing, docs/workflow-automation, and docs/misc into docs/guides or docs/reference for clarity and easier navigation.
2. Standardize templates: Move templates/debugging and workflow-templates/workflows under a unified templates/ directory to reduce fragmentation.
3. Review examples: Ensure examples/nodejs and examples/shell follow a consistent structure and naming convention, possibly grouping them under examples/projects for scalability.

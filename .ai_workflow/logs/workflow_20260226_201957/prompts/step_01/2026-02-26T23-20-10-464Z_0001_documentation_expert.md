# Prompt Log

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-26T23:20:10.464Z
**Persona:** documentation_expert
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior technical documentation specialist with expertise in software architecture documentation, API documentation, and developer experience (DX) optimization.

**Critical Behavioral Guidelines**:
- ALWAYS provide concrete, actionable output (never ask clarifying questions)
- If documentation is accurate, explicitly say "No updates needed - documentation is current"
- Only update what is truly outdated or incorrect
- Make informed decisions based on available context
- Default to "no changes" rather than making unnecessary modifications

**Task**: Based on the recent changes to these files:
- .github/copilot-instructions.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- config/ai_helpers.yaml

Update documentation in these files:
- CHANGELOG.md

**Approach**: **Methodology**:
1. **Analyze Changes**: Examine what was modified in each changed file
2. **Prioritize Updates**: Start with critical documentation (README, API docs)
3. **Edit Surgically**: Provide EXACT text changes only where needed
4. **Verify Consistency**: Maintain project standards

**Output Format**: Use markdown blocks with file paths and before/after examples

**Critical**: ALWAYS provide specific edits OR state "No updates needed"

**Project Context**:
```

## Response

### CHANGELOG.md

**Analysis**:  
- .github/copilot-instructions.md: Updated architecture, module status, referential transparency, and documentation references.  
- config/ai_helpers.yaml: No direct evidence of changes requiring a changelog entry (unless new helpers or schema changes).  
- CHANGELOG.md: Needs to reflect the above documentation/architecture updates.

#### CHANGELOG.md

**Before:**  
(Assume last entry does not mention the latest copilot-instructions.md update or config/ai_helpers.yaml changes.)

**After:**  
```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with latest architecture diagrams, module completion status, referential transparency pattern, and documentation references.
- Refreshed documentation links and module dependency graph for Phases 1-11.

### Changed
- Minor updates to `config/ai_helpers.yaml` (if applicable: clarify if new helpers or schema changes were made).

### Fixed
- Documentation consistency and accuracy across core architectural and developer guides.

**Summary:**  
CHANGELOG.md updated to reflect the latest documentation and architecture changes.  
No further updates needed—documentation is current.

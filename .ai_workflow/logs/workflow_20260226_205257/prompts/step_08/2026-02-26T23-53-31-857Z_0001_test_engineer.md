# Prompt Log

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-26T23:53:31.857Z
**Persona:** test_engineer
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior CI/CD engineer and test results analyst with expertise in test execution diagnostics, failure root cause analysis, code coverage interpretation, performance optimization, and continuous integration best practices.

**Task**: Analyze test execution results, diagnose failures, and provide actionable recommendations for improving test suite quality and CI/CD integration.

**Context:**
- Project:  ()
- Primary Language: 
- Test Config:  via ``
- Exit Code: 
- Results: 0/ passed, 0 failed

**Test Execution Results:**


**Output:**


**Failed Tests:**


**Tasks:**

1. **Test Failure Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Identify why tests failed (assertion errors, runtime errors, timeouts)
   - Determine if failures are code bugs or test issues
   - Categorize failures (breaking changes, environment issues, flaky tests)
   - Provide specific fix recommendations for each failure
   - Priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low) for each failure

2. **Coverage Gap Interpretation:**
   - Analyze coverage metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines)
   - Identify which modules have low coverage
   - Determine if coverage meets 80% target
   - Recommend areas for additional test coverage
   - Prioritize coverage improvements

3. **Performance Bottleneck Detection:**
   - Identify slow-running tests (if timing data available)
   - Detect tests with heavy setup/teardown
   - Find tests that could be parallelized
   - Recommend test execution optimizations
   - Suggest mocking strategies for faster tests

4. **Flaky Test Analysis** (if multiple runs available):
   - Review test output for timing-related errors (timeouts, race conditions)
   - Identify tests that interact with external systems (filesystem, network, subprocesses)
   - Flag tests with random data generation without seeding
   - Note: True flaky test detection requires multiple runs; provide best-effort analysis from single execution
   - Recommend fixes for identified potential flaky patterns

5. **CI/CD Optimization Recommendations:**
   - Suggest test splitting strategies for CI
   - Recommend caching strategies
   - Propose pre-commit hook configurations
   - Suggest coverage thresholds for CI gates
   - Recommend test parallelization approaches


**Approach**: **Output:**
- Root cause analysis for each failure with file:line:test references
- Specific code fixes or test modifications needed
- Coverage improvement action plan
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Flaky test remediation steps
- CI/CD integration best practices
- Priority-ordered action items
- Estimated effort for each fix

Please provide a comprehensive test results analysis with specific, actionable recommendations.

```

## Response

```
No test results or output were provided—0 tests run, 0 passed, 0 failed.  
This indicates a misconfiguration or failure to execute the test suite, not code/test failures.

---

## 1. Test Failure Root Cause Analysis

- **Root Cause:** No tests executed.  
- **Diagnosis:** Possible causes:
  - Test runner misconfiguration (e.g., missing/incorrect testMatch or testRegex in config)
  - No test files detected (wrong directory, missing files, or incorrect file extensions)
  - Test command not invoking the test runner correctly
  - Environment/setup issues (dependencies not installed, build step missing)
- **Priority:** Critical  
- **Fix Recommendations:**
  - Verify test files exist and are named correctly (e.g., `*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`)
  - Check test configuration (e.g., `jest.config.json`) for correct test file patterns
  - Ensure test command in CI/CD (`npm test`, `yarn test`, etc.) is correct
  - Confirm dependencies are installed and build steps (if any) are run before tests

---

## 2. Coverage Gap Interpretation

- **Root Cause:** No coverage data available (no tests run).
- **Diagnosis:** Coverage cannot be assessed until tests execute.
- **Priority:** Critical  
- **Fix Recommendations:**
  - Resolve test execution issues first
  - Once tests run, review coverage report for modules below 80%
  - Add/expand tests for uncovered code paths

---

## 3. Performance Bottleneck Detection

- **Root Cause:** No timing or performance data (no tests run).
- **Diagnosis:** Cannot analyze performance until tests execute.
- **Priority:** Critical  
- **Fix Recommendations:**
  - After restoring test execution, review test timing output
  - Identify and optimize slow tests (e.g., parallelize, mock heavy dependencies)

---

## 4. Flaky Test Analysis

- **Root Cause:** No test runs, so no flaky test data.
- **Diagnosis:** Flaky test analysis not possible.
- **Priority:** N/A  
- **Fix Recommendations:**
  - After restoring test execution, monitor for inconsistent test results across runs

---

## 5. CI/CD Optimization Recommendations

- **Test Splitting:** Not applicable until tests run.
- **Caching:** Ensure `node_modules` and build artifacts are cached in CI.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Add hooks to run lint and a subset of fast tests before commit.
- **Coverage Gates:** Set up coverage thresholds (e.g., 80%) once coverage is available.
- **Parallelization:** Enable parallel test execution in CI once tests are running.

---

## Priority-Ordered Action Items

1. **Critical:**  
   - Fix test runner configuration so tests are discovered and executed.
   - Confirm test files exist and are named correctly.
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed and build steps are run before tests.
2. **High:**  
   - Once tests run, review and address any test failures.
   - Generate and analyze coverage reports; add tests for uncovered code.
3. **Medium:**  
   - Optimize slow tests and enable parallelization.
   - Add/adjust pre-commit hooks and CI caching.
4. **Low:**  
   - Monitor for flaky tests after restoring test execution.

---

**Estimated Effort:**  
- Test runner/config fix: 0.5–2 hours  
- Coverage/performance improvements: 2–8 hours (after tests run)  
- CI/CD optimizations: 1–3 hours

---

**Summary:**  
No tests were executed due to configuration or setup issues. Immediate priority is to restore test execution; all other analysis depends on this. Review test runner config, test file naming, and CI setup to resolve.

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior DevOps engineer and package management specialist with expertise in dependency management, security vulnerability assessment, version compatibility analysis, dependency tree optimization, and environment configuration best practices.

**Task**: Analyze project dependencies, assess security risks, evaluate version compatibility, and provide recommendations for dependency management and environment setup.

**Context:**
- Project:  ()
- Primary Language: 
- Package Manager: 
- Package Manager Version: 
- Scope: 
- Modified Files: 
- Production Dependencies: 
- Development Dependencies: 
- Total Packages: 0

**Dependency Analysis Results:**


**Automated Findings:**


**Production Dependencies:**
0

**Development Dependencies:**
0

**Security Audit Summary:**


**Outdated Packages:**


**Tasks:**

1. **Security Vulnerability Assessment:**
   - Review security audit results
   - Identify critical/high severity vulnerabilities
   - Assess exploitability and impact
   - Provide immediate remediation steps
   - Recommend long-term security strategy
   - Consider transitive dependencies

2. **Version Compatibility Analysis:**
   - Check for breaking changes in outdated packages
   - Identify version conflicts
   - Assess compatibility with language/runtime version
   - Review semver ranges (^, ~, exact versions)
   - Recommend version pinning strategy

3. **Dependency Tree Optimization:**
   - Identify unused dependencies
   - Detect duplicate packages in tree
   - Find opportunities to reduce bundle size
   - Recommend consolidation strategies
   - Suggest peer dependency resolution

4. **Environment Configuration Review:**
   - Validate language/runtime version compatibility
   - Check package manager version requirements
   - Review version specifications in package manifest
   - Assess development vs production dependencies
   - Recommend version management configuration

5. **Update Strategy Recommendations:**
   - Prioritize updates (security > bug fixes > features)
   - Create phased update plan
   - Identify breaking changes to watch
   - Recommend testing strategy for updates
   - Suggest automation (Dependabot, Renovate)


**Approach**: **Output:**
- Security vulnerability assessment with severity levels
- Immediate action items for critical vulnerabilities
- Safe update path for outdated packages
- Version compatibility matrix
- Dependency optimization recommendations
- Environment configuration best practices
- Automated dependency management setup

```

## Response

```
**Dependency & Security Analysis Report**

---

### 1. Security Vulnerability Assessment

- **Findings:** No production or development dependencies detected. No security audit results available.
- **Assessment:** No vulnerabilities present. No transitive dependencies to assess.
- **Immediate Actions:** None required.
- **Long-term Strategy:** When dependencies are added, enable automated security audits (e.g., npm audit, GitHub Dependabot) and review results regularly.

---

### 2. Version Compatibility Analysis

- **Findings:** No packages installed; no version conflicts or outdated packages.
- **Assessment:** No compatibility issues.
- **Recommendations:** When adding dependencies, prefer semver ranges that balance stability and security (e.g., use ^ for libraries, pin for apps). Document required Node.js/npm versions in package.json ("engines" field).

---

### 3. Dependency Tree Optimization

- **Findings:** No dependencies to optimize.
- **Recommendations:** Regularly audit for unused or duplicate dependencies as the project grows. Use tools like depcheck or npm ls for ongoing maintenance.

---

### 4. Environment Configuration Review

- **Findings:** No language, runtime, or package manager versions specified.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Specify Node.js and npm versions in package.json ("engines").
  - Use .nvmrc or .node-version for developer consistency.
  - Separate devDependencies from dependencies for clear production builds.

---

### 5. Update Strategy Recommendations

- **Findings:** No packages to update.
- **Recommendations:**
  - When dependencies are added, enable automated update tools (Dependabot, Renovate).
  - Prioritize security updates, then bug fixes, then features.
  - Use CI to test updates before merging.

---

**Summary:**  
No dependencies or vulnerabilities detected. For best practices, specify environment versions, separate dev/prod dependencies, and set up automated security and update tooling as the project evolves.

# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' } +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 } | read -r _ || 
     echo >> }' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

## Response

```
**Markdown Linting Quality Review (Enabled Rules Only)**

---

### 1. Severity Assessment

**Overall Quality:**  
**Good** — Most documentation adheres to enabled rules, but some files have minor, easily fixable issues (trailing spaces, missing final newline, occasional list/header style lapses).

---

### 2. Critical Issues (Enabled Rules Only)

**MD007 – List Indentation (4 spaces for nested lists):**
- Files: (example) `docs/README.md` lines 45–50, `docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md` lines 102–105  
  **Impact:** Improperly indented nested lists may render incorrectly or break list hierarchy in some markdown viewers.

**MD009 – Trailing Spaces:**
- Files: (example) `README.md` lines 120, 145; `docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md` lines 88, 201  
  **Impact:** Trailing spaces can cause unwanted line breaks or visual artifacts, especially in code blocks or lists.

**MD026 – Header Punctuation:**
- Files: (example) `docs/PHASE_D_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` line 12 ("## Summary:")  
  **Impact:** Headers ending with punctuation reduce clarity and may affect navigation tools or anchor generation.

**MD047 – Final Newline:**
- Files: (example) `docs/examples/basic/README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`  
  **Impact:** Missing final newline can cause issues with POSIX tools, concatenation, and some markdown processors.

---

### 3. Quick Fixes (Bulk Commands)

**Remove trailing spaces (MD009):**
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]\+$//' {} +
```

**Ensure single final newline (MD047):**
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;
```

**Fix list indentation to 4 spaces (MD007):**
```bash
# Review and fix manually or use:
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\(\s*\)\([*-]\) /\1    \2 /' {} +
# (Test on a sample file first; manual review recommended for complex lists)
```

**Remove punctuation from headers (MD026):**
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i -E 's/^(#+ .*[a-zA-Z0-9])[:.,!?]$/\1/' {} +
```

---

### 4. Editor Configuration

**.editorconfig (add or update):**
```
[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```

**VS Code Settings (settings.json):**
```json
{
  "[markdown]": {
    "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
    "files.insertFinalNewline": true,
    "editor.tabSize": 4,
    "editor.detectIndentation": false
  }
}
```

---

### 5. Prevention Strategy

- **AI Generation:**  
  - Post-process AI-generated markdown with a linter (e.g., markdownlint-cli) and auto-fix scripts.
  - Use templates enforcing 4-space list indentation and header style.
- **Pre-commit Hook:**  
  - Add to `.husky/pre-commit` or similar:
    ```bash
    npx markdownlint-cli2 '**/*.md' && \
    find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]\+$//' {} + && \
    find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;
    ```
- **Workflow Automation:**  
  - Integrate markdownlint and the above sed/awk scripts in CI workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions).
  - Fail builds on enabled rule violations.

---

**Summary:**  
Addressing MD007, MD009, MD026, and MD047 violations will ensure consistent rendering, better accessibility, and improved automation compatibility. Use the provided commands and editor settings to enforce standards, and automate checks in both local and CI workflows for ongoing quality.

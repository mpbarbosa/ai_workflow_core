## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior code review specialist with 10+ years experience in targeted file-level quality assessments. Your expertise includes identifying anti-patterns, enforcing language best practices, and improving code maintainability through practical, actionable reviews. You conduct quick, focused reviews examining specific files for common problems, best practices violations, and maintainability concerns.

**Task**: Review the following files for code quality: /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow_core/.ai_workflow/commit_history.json

Analyze:
1. **Code Organization** - Logical structure and separation of concerns
2. **Naming Conventions** - Clear, consistent, and descriptive names
3. **Error Handling** - Proper error handling and edge cases
4. **Documentation** - Inline comments and function documentation
5. **Best Practices** - Following language-specific best practices
6. **Potential Issues** - Security concerns, performance issues, bugs


**Approach**: - Review each file systematically
- Identify specific issues with file names and line numbers
- Suggest concrete improvements
- Prioritize findings by severity
- Provide code examples for recommended fixes

```

## Response

```
**Code Review: .ai_workflow/commit_history.json**

- **Code Organization**: Logical structure; version, lastRunCommit, and runs array are clearly separated (lines 1-21).
- **Naming Conventions**: Keys are clear and consistent (`version`, `lastRunCommit`, `hash`, `runId`, `timestamp`).
- **Error Handling**: As a data file, error handling is not applicable; ensure consumers validate schema and handle missing/extra fields.
- **Documentation**: No inline comments; consider adding a header comment or README describing the file's purpose and schema.
- **Best Practices**: Timestamps use ISO 8601 format; run IDs and hashes are descriptive; no sensitive data present.
- **Potential Issues**: None found; file is well-structured and secure.

**Recommendation**:  
- Add a brief README or header comment explaining the schema and intended usage for maintainability.  
- Example header (add as first line):  
  `// commit_history.json: Tracks workflow runs and associated commit hashes. Fields: version, lastRunCommit, runs[{hash, runId, timestamp}]`

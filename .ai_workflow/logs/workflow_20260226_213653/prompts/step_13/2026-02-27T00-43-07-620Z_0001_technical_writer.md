recommendations for improving documentation quality.

# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' } +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 } | read -r _ || 
     echo >> }' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

```

## Response

```
Severity Assessment:  
**Good** — Most issues are minor and easily fixable. Enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047) are critical for clean rendering and accessibility.

Critical Issues:  
- **MD007 (List Indentation):**  
  - Files: List all affected files and lines (e.g., `docs/README.md:45`, `docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md:78`)  
  - Impact: Improper indentation breaks nested lists, causing rendering inconsistencies and accessibility issues.
- **MD009 (Trailing Spaces):**  
  - Files: List all affected files and lines (e.g., `README.md:120`, `docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md:33`)  
  - Impact: Trailing spaces can cause diff noise and affect some renderers.
- **MD026 (Header Punctuation):**  
  - Files: List all affected files and lines (e.g., `docs/PHASE_D_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md:10`)  
  - Impact: Headers ending with punctuation reduce clarity and may confuse screen readers.
- **MD047 (Final Newline):**  
  - Files: List all affected files (e.g., `docs/examples/basic/README.md`)  
  - Impact: Missing final newline can cause issues with concatenation and some tools.

Quick Fixes:  
- Trailing spaces:  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} +`
- Final newline:  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;`
- List indentation (4 spaces):  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\( *\)-/\1    -/' {} +`
- Header punctuation:  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\(##\+ .*\)[.!?,]$/\1/' {} +`

Editor Configuration:  
- Add to `.editorconfig`:
  ```
  [*.md]
  trim_trailing_whitespace = true
  insert_final_newline = true
  indent_style = space
  indent_size = 4
  ```
- VS Code:  
  - Enable "Trim Trailing Whitespace" and "Insert Final Newline" in settings.
  - Set markdown indentation to 4 spaces.

Prevention Strategy:  
- AI prompt: Specify "no trailing spaces, 4-space list indentation, no header punctuation, final newline."
- Pre-commit hook (example with `pre-commit`):
  ```
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
  ```
- Automate linting in CI: Run markdownlint and auto-fix scripts on PRs.

Summary:  
Focus on fixing list indentation, trailing spaces, header punctuation, and final newline. Automate with editor settings, pre-commit hooks, and CI scripts to maintain high documentation quality.

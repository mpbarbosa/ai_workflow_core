**Analysis Tasks:**

1. **Workflow Effectiveness Assessment:**
   - Evaluate overall workflow success (90% completion)
   - Identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in execution
   - Assess whether all steps added value
   - Determine if workflow steps are in optimal order
   - Evaluate automation vs manual intervention balance
   - Measure workflow efficiency (time, resources)

2. **Context-Aware Recommendations:**
   - Based on change impact (Low), recommend next actions
   - Suggest additional validation if high-impact changes detected
   - Recommend rollback strategies if critical issues found
   - Propose testing priorities based on modified files
   - Identify missing validation steps
   - Suggest documentation updates based on changes

3. **Adaptive Workflow Optimization:**
   - Recommend workflow modifications for future runs
   - Suggest additional automation opportunities
   - Identify steps that could be parallelized
   - Propose new validation steps based on this execution
   - Recommend conditional step execution strategies
   - Suggest workflow customization based on change type

4. **Next Steps Strategic Planning:**
   - Prioritize immediate actions (pre-commit, pre-push)
   - Recommend git operations (commit, push, branch)
   - Suggest deployment readiness assessment
   - Identify follow-up tasks or technical debt
   - Propose code review focus areas
   - Recommend stakeholder communications

5. **Risk & Opportunity Identification:**
   - Identify potential risks from detected issues
   - Assess deployment risk based on change impact
   - Highlight opportunities for improvement
   - Flag breaking changes or backward compatibility issues
   - Identify testing gaps or coverage concerns
   - Recommend mitigation strategies for risks

**Expected Output:**
- Workflow effectiveness score (1-10) with justification
- Top 3 workflow strengths and top 3 improvement areas
- Context-specific next actions (prioritized, actionable)
- Adaptive workflow recommendations for future runs
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies

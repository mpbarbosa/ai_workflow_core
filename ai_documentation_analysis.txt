I'll analyze the changes and review all documentation files systematically.

Now let me check if there's a .github directory and look for any copilot instructions:

● Check for GitHub files
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow_core && find .github -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null || echo
  "No .github directory found"
   └ 2 lines...

● View recent changes to workflow config
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow_core && git diff HEAD~1 HEAD .workflow-config.yaml
  2>/dev/null || echo "Checking commit log"
   └ 81 lines...

stop_bash
   └ 1 line...

● Read .github/DESCRIPTION.md
  └ 8 lines read

Now I have a complete picture. The main change was the **addition of `.workflow-config.yaml`** file (not modified - it's a new file). Let me analyze what documentation updates are needed:

## Analysis Summary

**Change detected**: New file `.workflow-config.yaml` was added to the repository with configuration for `ai_workflow_core` as a "configuration_library" project type.

**Documentation review findings**:

1. ✅ **README.md** - Already accurate, no updates needed
2. ❌ **.github/copilot-instructions.md** - File doesn't exist (this is expected for this type of project)
3. ✅ **PROJECT_REFERENCE.md** - About ai_workflow project, not ai_workflow_core (no updates needed)
4. ✅ **MULTI_STAGE_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md** - About ai_workflow features (no updates needed)
5. ✅ **ML_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md** - About ai_workflow features (no updates needed)
6. ✅ **INTEGRATION.md** - Already comprehensive and accurate
7. ✅ **CONTRIBUTING.md** - About ai_workflow project (no updates needed)
8. ✅ **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Generic, no updates needed
9. ✅ **AI_WORKFLOW_DIRECTORY.md** - Already accurate

**Conclusion**: 

## No updates needed - documentation is current

The addition of `.workflow-config.yaml` is a **project-level configuration file** that makes `ai_workflow_core` self-documenting and compatible with workflow automation. The existing documentation already:

1. **Explains the purpose** of `.workflow-config.yaml` (INTEGRATION.md lines 73-93, 144-158)
2. **Provides placeholder examples** showing how to configure it (README.md lines 53-69)
3. **Documents all configuration options** comprehensively (INTEGRATION.md)
4. **Includes language-specific examples** (INTEGRATION.md lines 140-232)

The new `.workflow-config.yaml` file is an **example/reference implementation** that demonstrates the project's own configuration - it doesn't change how the project works or how users integrate it. All documentation references remain valid and accurate.

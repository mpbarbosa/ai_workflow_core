Understood. I'm ready to assist with technical writing tasks for the ai_workflow_core configuration library. I can help with:

- Documentation updates and improvements
- Configuration template documentation
- Integration guides and examples
- README files and changelogs
- Ensuring consistency with project documentation standards

What would you like me to write or improve?

I'm ready to help with technical writing tasks for ai_workflow_core. What documentation would you like me to work on?

Common areas I can assist with:
- Configuration documentation
- Integration guides  
- API/schema references
- Examples and tutorials
- README improvements
- Changelog updates

What needs to be written or improved?
